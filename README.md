# Terraform-based Kubernetes Resource Management

This project provides a robust framework for managing Kubernetes resources using Terraform. It is designed to be driven by events, allowing for automated creation, updates, and deletion of resources in a Kubernetes cluster. The provided shell scripts and sample event payloads facilitate both automated and manual operations.

## Overview

The core of this project is a set of Terraform configurations designed to declaratively manage the state of your Kubernetes infrastructure. The accompanying scripts act as wrappers around the Terraform CLI to provide a simplified interface for common operations. This event-driven approach is ideal for integration with CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, or other automation systems.

## Features

*   **Declarative Infrastructure:** Define your Kubernetes resources as code using Terraform.
*   **Event-Driven Automation:** Easily integrate with automation systems through event-based triggers.
*   **Modular Design:** The Terraform code is structured into reusable modules for better organization and scalability.
*   **Simplified Workflow:** Helper scripts abstract away the complexity of running Terraform commands.
*   **State Management:** Centralized and secure state management using a configurable Terraform backend.

## How It Works

The management process is straightforward:

1.  An external event (e.g., a webhook from a CI/CD pipeline) triggers one of the control scripts (`create-k8s-resources.sh`, `update-k8s-resources.sh`, `delete-k8s-resources.sh`).
2.  A JSON payload (like `create-resources-event.json`) is passed to the script, providing necessary parameters.
3.  The script initializes Terraform, selects the appropriate workspace, and applies the configuration to the target Kubernetes cluster.
4.  Terraform communicates with the Kubernetes API to create, modify, or remove resources to match the desired state defined in the `.tf` files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Terraform** (latest version recommended)
*   **kubectl**
*   **Cloud Provider CLI** (e.g., AWS CLI, gcloud, Azure CLI)
*   A running Kubernetes cluster
*   `kubeconfig` file correctly configured to access your cluster

## Configuration

1.  **Terraform Backend:**
    Navigate to the `terraform/shared-state/` directory and configure the `backend.tf` file with your desired remote state storage details (e.g., S3 bucket, DynamoDB table). This is crucial for collaboration and state locking.

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    The scripts may require certain environment variables to be set, such as cloud provider credentials or cluster connection details. Please refer to the script source for specific requirements.

## Usage

You can run the scripts locally to manually manage resources. The primary purpose of the `.json` files is to simulate the event payloads that would be passed in an automated environment.
